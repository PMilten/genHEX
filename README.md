A GenHEX_sample.py file can now be downloaded.  
It contains the setup required for an annular heat exchanger using the correlations given in the above publication for aerothermal performance.  
Also a method for using a specific HEX from Kays and London library is functional, requires the KaysLondonCollection.xlsx.
